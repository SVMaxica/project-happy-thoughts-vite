# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I had some issues getting the page to refresh after every like or new input, also struggled with getteing the gratient heading to look the same as the example. used team and chat and google to solve it.
